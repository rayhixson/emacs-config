;;; Commentary:

;; Overview
;; --------
;;
;; This module lets you access the PostgreSQL object-relational DBMS from
;; Emacs, using its socket-level frontend/backend protocol. The module is
;; capable of automatic type coercions from a range of SQL types to the
;; equivalent Emacs Lisp type. This is a low level API, and won't be
;; useful to end users.
;;
;; Supported features:
;;  - SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication (the default method since PostgreSQL version 14)
;;  - MD5 authentication
;;  - Encrypted (TLS) connections


;; Entry points
;; ------------
;;
;; (with-pg-connection con (dbname user [password host port]) &body body)
;;     A macro which opens a connection to database DBNAME over a TCP socket,
;;     executes the BODY forms then disconnects. See function `pg-connect' for
;;     details of the connection arguments.
;;
;; (with-pg-connection-local con (path dbname user [password]) &body body)
;;     A macro which opens a connection to database DBNAME over a local Unix
;;     socket at PATH, executes the BODY forms then disconnects. See function
;;     `pg-connect-local' for details of the connection arguments.
;;
;; (with-pg-transaction con &body body)
;;     A macro which executes the BODY forms wrapped in an SQL transaction.
;;     CON is a connection to the database. If an error occurs during the
;;     execution of the forms, a ROLLBACK instruction is executed.
;;
;; (pg-connect dbname user [password host port tls]) -> connection
;;     Connect to the database DBNAME on HOST (defaults to localhost) at PORT
;;     (defaults to 5432) via TCP/IP and log in as USER. PASSWORD is used for
;;     authentication with the backend (defaults to the empty string). If TLS is
;;     non-NIL, attempt to upgrade the connection to TLS. Set the output date
;;     type to 'ISO', and initialize our type parser tables.
;;
;; (pg-connect-local path dbname user [password]) -> connection
;;     Connect to the database DBNAME over local Unix socket at PATH and log in
;;     as USER. PASSWORD is used for authentication with the backend (defaults
;;     to the empty string). Set the output date type to 'ISO', and initialize
;;     our type parser tables.
;;
;; (pg-exec connection &rest sql) -> pgresult
;;     Concatenate the SQL strings and send to the backend. Retrieve
;;     all the information returned by the database and return it in
;;     an opaque record PGRESULT.
;;
;; (pg-result pgresult what &rest args) -> info
;;     Extract information from the PGRESULT. The WHAT keyword can be
;;     one of
;;          * :connection
;;          * :status
;;          * :attributes
;;          * :tuples
;;          * :tuple tupleNumber
;;          * :oid
;;     `:connection' allows you to retrieve the database connection.
;;     `:status' is a string returned by the backend to indicate the
;;     status of the command; it is something like "SELECT" for a
;;     select command, "DELETE 1" if the deletion affected a single
;;     row, etc. `:attributes' is a list of tuples providing metadata:
;;     the first component of each tuple is the attribute's name as a
;;     string, the second an integer representing its PostgreSQL type,
;;     and the third an integer representing the size of that type.
;;     `:tuples' returns all the data retrieved from the database, as a
;;     list of lists, each list corresponding to one row of data
;;     returned by the backend. `:tuple num' can be used to extract a
;;     specific tuple (numbering starts at 0). `:oid' allows you to
;;     retrieve the OID returned by the backend if the command was an
;;     insertion; the OID is a unique identifier for that row in the
;;     database (this is PostgreSQL-specific, please refer to the
;;     documentation for more details).
;;
;; (pg-cancel connection) -> nil
;;     Ask the server to cancel the command being processed by the backend.
;;     The cancellation request concerns the command requested over
;;     database connection CONNECTION.
;;
;; (pg-disconnect connection) -> nil
;;     Close the database connection.
;;
;; (pg-for-each connection select-form callback)
;;     Calls CALLBACK on each tuple returned by SELECT-FORM. Declares
;;     a cursor for SELECT-FORM, then fetches tuples using repeated
;;     executions of FETCH 1, until no results are left. The cursor is
;;     then closed. The work is performed within a transaction. When
;;     you have a large amount of data to handle, this usage is more
;;     efficient than fetching all the tuples in one go.
;;
;;     If you wish to browse the results, each one in a separate
;;     buffer, you could have the callback insert each tuple into a
;;     buffer created with (generate-new-buffer "myprefix"), then use
;;     ibuffer's "/ n" to list/visit/delete all buffers whose names
;;     match myprefix.
;;
;; (pg-databases connection) -> list of strings
;;     Return a list of the databases available at this site (a
;;     database is a set of tables; in a fresh PostgreSQL
;;     installation there is a single database named "template1").
;;
;; (pg-tables connection) -> list of strings
;;     Return a list of the tables present in the database to which we
;;     are currently connected. Only include user tables: system
;;     tables are excluded.
;;
;; (pg-columns connection table) -> list of strings
;;     Return a list of the columns (or attributes) in TABLE, which
;;     must be a table in the database to which we are currently
;;     connected. We only include the column names; if you want more
;;     detailed information (attribute types, for example), it can be
;;     obtained from `pg-result' on a SELECT statement for that table.
;;
;; (pg-hstore-setup conn)
;;     Prepare for the use of HSTORE datatypes. This function must be called
;;     before using the HSTORE extension. It loads the extension if necessary,
;;     and sets up the parsing support for HSTORE datatypes.
;;
;; (pg-lo-create conn . args) -> oid
;;     Create a new large object (BLOB, or binary large object in
;;     other DBMSes parlance) in the database to which we are
;;     connected via CONN. Returns an OID (which is represented as an
;;     elisp integer) which will allow you to use the large object.
;;     Optional ARGS are a Unix-style mode string which determines the
;;     permissions of the newly created large object, one of "r" for
;;     read-only permission, "w" for write-only, "rw" for read+write.
;;     Default is "r".
;;
;;     Large-object functions MUST be used within a transaction (see
;;     the macro `with-pg-transaction').
;;
;; (pg-lo-open conn oid . args) -> fd
;;     Open a large object whose unique identifier is OID (an elisp
;;     integer) in the database to which we are connected via CONN.
;;     Optional ARGS is a Unix-style mode string as for pg-lo-create;
;;     which defaults to "r" read-only permissions. Returns a file
;;     descriptor (an elisp integer) which can be used in other
;;     large-object functions.
;;
;; (pg-lo-close conn fd)
;;     Close the file descriptor FD which was associated with a large
;;     object. Note that this does not delete the large object; use
;;     `pg-lo-unlink' for that.
;;
;; (pg-lo-read conn fd bytes) -> string
;;     Read BYTES from the file descriptor FD which is associated with
;;     a large object. Return an elisp string which should be BYTES
;;     characters long.
;;
;; (pg-lo-write connection fd buf)
;;     Write the bytes contained in the elisp string BUF to the
;;     large object associated with the file descriptor FD.
;;
;; (pg-lo-lseek conn fd offset whence)
;;     Do the equivalent of a lseek(2) on the file descriptor FD which
;;     is associated with a large object; ie reposition the read/write
;;     file offset for that large object to OFFSET (an elisp
;;     integer). WHENCE has the same significance as in lseek(); it
;;     should be one of SEEK_SET (set the offset to the absolute
;;     position), SEEK_CUR (set the offset relative to the current
;;     offset) or SEEK_END (set the offset relative to the end of the
;;     file). WHENCE should be an elisp integer whose values can be
;;     obtained from the header file <unistd.h> (probably 0, 1 and 2
;;     respectively).
;;
;; (pg-lo-tell conn oid) -> integer
;;     Do the equivalent of an ftell(3) on the file associated with
;;     the large object whose unique identifier is OID. Returns the
;;     current position of the file offset for the object's associated
;;     file descriptor, as an elisp integer.
;;
;; (pg-lo-unlink conn oid)
;;     Remove the large object whose unique identifier is OID from the
;;     system (in the current implementation of large objects in
;;     PostgreSQL, each large object is associated with an object in
;;     the filesystem).
;;
;; (pg-lo-import conn filename) -> oid
;;     Create a new large object and initialize it to the data
;;     contained in the file whose name is FILENAME. Returns an OID
;;     (as an elisp integer). Note that is operation is only syntactic
;;     sugar around the basic large-object operations listed above.
;;
;; (pg-lo-export conn oid filename)
;;     Create a new file named FILENAME and fill it with the contents
;;     of the large object whose unique identifier is OID. This
;;     operation is also syntactic sugar.
;;
;;
;; Variable `pg-parameter-change-functions' is a list of handlers to be called
;; when the backend informs us of a parameter change, for example a change to
;; the session time zone. Each handler is called with three arguments: the
;; connection to the backend, the parameter name and the parameter value.
;;
;; Variable `pg-handle-notice-functions' is a list of handlers to be called when
;; the backend sends us a `NOTICE' message. Each handler is called with one
;; argument, the notice, as a pgerror struct.
;;
;; Boolean variable `pg-disable-type-coercion' can be set to non-nil (before
;; initiating a connection) to disable the library's type coercion facility.
;; Default is t.

;;
;; Thanks to Eric Ludlam for discovering a bug in the date parsing routines, to
;; Hartmut Pilch and Yoshio Katayama for adding multibyte support, and to Doug
;; McNaught and Pavel Janik for bug fixes.


;;; INSTALL
;;
;; Place this file in a directory somewhere in the load-path, then
;; byte-compile it (do a `B' on it in Dired, for example). Place a
;; line such as `(require 'pg)' in your Emacs initialization file.


;;; TODO
;;
;; * Provide support for client-side certificates to authenticate network
;;   connections over TLS.
;;
;; * Implement the SASLPREP algorithm for usernames and passwords that contain
;;   unprintable characters (used for SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication).
;;
;; * Add a mechanism for parsing user-defined types. The user should
;;   be able to define a parse function and a type-name; we query
;;   pg_type to get the type's OID and add the information to
;;   pg-parsers.

;; type coercion support ==============================================
;;
;; When returning data from a SELECT statement, PostgreSQL starts by
;; sending some metadata describing the attributes. This information
;; is read by `pg-read-attributes', and consists of each attribute's
;; name (as a string), its size (in bytes), and its type (as an oid
;; which identifies a row in the PostgreSQL system table pg_type). Each
;; row in pg_type includes the type's name (as a string).
;;
;; We are able to parse a certain number of the PostgreSQL types (for
;; example, numeric data is converted to a numeric Emacs Lisp type,
;; dates are converted to the Emacs date representation, booleans to
;; Emacs Lisp booleans). However, there isn't a fixed mapping from a
;; type to its OID which is guaranteed to be stable across database
;; installations, so we need to build a table mapping OIDs to parser
;; functions.
;;
;; This is done by the procedure `pg-initialize-parsers', which is run
;; the first time a connection is initiated with the database from
;; this invocation of Emacs, and which issues a SELECT statement to
;; extract the required information from pg_type. This initialization
;; imposes a slight overhead on the first request, which you can avoid
;; by setting `pg-disable-type-coercion' to non-nil if it bothers you.
;; ====================================================================

;; This is a var not a const to allow user-defined types (a PostgreSQL
;; feature not present in ANSI SQL). The user can add a (type-name .
;; type-parser) pair and call `pg-initialize-parsers', after which the
;; user-defined type should be returned parsed from `pg-result'.

;; large object support ================================================
;;
;; Humphrey: Who is Large and to what does he object?
;;
;; Large objects are the PostgreSQL way of doing what most databases
;; call BLOBs (binary large objects). In addition to being able to
;; stream data to and from large objects, PostgreSQL's
;; object-relational capabilities allow the user to provide functions
;; which act on the objects.
;;
;; For example, the user can define a new type called "circle", and
;; define a C or Tcl function called `circumference' which will act on
;; circles. There is also an inheritance mechanism in PostgreSQL.
